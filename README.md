# DiffMoog: A Modular Differential Commercial-like Synthesizer

This repo contains the implementation of DiffMoog, a differential, subtractive, modular synthesizer, incorporating standard architecture and sound modules commonly found in commercial synthesizers.

In the repo is code for the synthesizer modules and architecture, as well as a platform for training and evaluating sound matching models using the synthesizer as a basis.

## Getting started
To get started, simply clone the repo and install the requirements in requirements.txt.

## Notebooks
In the *examples* directory, you will find several notebooks to help get you familiar with the DiffMoog synthesizer and its capabilities.

Start with **explore_presets.ipynb** and **create_dataset.ipynb** for introduction about the synth structure, configuration and sound generation.

Use **train_model.ipynb** and **evaluate_model.ipynb** to train and evaluate a sound matching model.
